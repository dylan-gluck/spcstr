Ignore QAs priorities, Scrum Master has analyzed the over-complicated implementation and wrote a specific document for you to help with implementation.\n\nThis needs to be done now, we are past deadline and the scrum master will fire one of us if it is not right this time. \n\nRead @docs/stories/1.5.story-change-1.md for the updated assignment. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to the updated model structure and adapt the examples available in:\n~/Workspace/contrib/bubbletea/examples\n~/Workspace/contrib/lipgloss/examples/\n\nRemember this is a simple TUI not rocket science. This should be the easiest part. Copy the examples and swap out the data \u0026 functionality with our services.\n\nGO TEAM!\n- Management",
