# Hook logic & State

The state management system is almost working as expected but there are some improvements we need to make.

Currently the session directories and state files are being created, and the tool use is being calculated, but we are not getting any info about subagent use, errors, files that have been accessed, etc.

The following examples were pulled from the `.spcstr/logs` directory. Analyze these and use `jq` to parse & analyze the log files to understand what data is being passed to the hook commands for processing.

# Post Tool Use

### TodoWrite

We should be able to calculate the number of Pending, Completed, total todo items for a session.

Use `jq` to analyze the full object from the event in the following snippet. The log is in `.spcstr/logs/post_tool_use.json`

Use this JSON structure to plan and implement the logic to calculate and store this session data.

Consider caching the most recent TODO item(s) in the state object for displaying in the dashboard view.

```json
Snippet:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-05T22:16:32.945212-04:00",
  "session_id": "3ef7f904-7316-4b70-881c-5d2ed8459bbc",
  "hook_name": "post_tool_use",
  "input_data": {
    "cwd": "/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/spcstr",
    "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
    "permission_mode": "bypassPermissions",
    "session_id": "3ef7f904-7316-4b70-881c-5d2ed8459bbc",
    ...
  }
}
```


## Write / Edit etc:

All file operations have the same schema structure. We care most about the `tool_name` and `filePath`.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-05T22:15:49.461752-04:00",
  "session_id": "3ef7f904-7316-4b70-881c-5d2ed8459bbc",
  "hook_name": "post_tool_use",
  "input_data": {
    "cwd": "/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/spcstr",
    "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
    "permission_mode": "bypassPermissions",
    "session_id": "3ef7f904-7316-4b70-881c-5d2ed8459bbc",
    "tool_input": {
      "content": "...",
      "file_path": "/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/spcstr/internal/tui/views/observe/observe.go"
    },
    "tool_name": "Write",
    "tool_response": {
      "content": "...",
      "filePath": "/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/spcstr/internal/tui/views/observe/observe.go",
      "structuredPatch": [],
      "type": "create"
    },
    "transcript_path": "/Users/dylan/.claude/projects/-Users-dylan-Workspace-projects-spcstr/3ef7f904-7316-4b70-881c-5d2ed8459bbc.jsonl"
  },
  "success": true
},
```

# Pre Tool Use

# Error calling tool

Here is an example of an error. Find the JSON log of this error or where it was blocked in .spcstr/logs/pre_tool_use.json

Errors must be logged in the session state.

meta-commit(Create git commit)
⎿  Running hook PreToolUse:Task...
⎿  Error: Read operation blocked by hook:
    - [spcstr hook pre_tool_use --cwd="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"]:                                                                     Warning: Failed to log hook event: failed to rename temp log

Also, Identify why this is failing we should not be doing any command filtering or security checks at this time. Do not block ANYTHING. Leave that to claude.

# Subagent Stop

## Agent Name??

Where did agent name come from? Agent name can only be extracted from pre/post tool use Task events. Remove this logic fully.

Commit: d5b0a30 - fix(hooks): make agent_name optional in
subagent_stop handler

The fix ensures that session termination won't fail due to
  missing agent_name parameters, improving the robustness
of the hook system integration with Claude Code.
