# Story 1.1: Project Structure and Build System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Go monorepo with proper structure and build configuration,
**so that** I can compile a single spcstr binary with embedded hook functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Go module initialized with go.mod at project root
2. Directory structure created: `cmd/spcstr/`, `internal/hooks/`, `internal/state/`, `internal/tui/`
3. Single Makefile or build script compiles one spcstr binary
4. Build process runs without errors on macOS and Linux
5. All Cobra, Bubbletea, Lipgloss, and Glamour dependencies properly imported
6. Binary size remains reasonable (<50MB) with embedded functionality

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize Go module and project root (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `go mod init github.com/username/spcstr` at project root
  - [x] Set Go version to 1.21+ in go.mod

### File Locations
Based on project structure requirements:
- **Main Entry Point**: `cmd/spcstr/main.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Hook Handlers**: `internal/hooks/handlers/` directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **State Management**: `internal/state/` directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **TUI Components**: `internal/tui/` directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Build System Requirements
- **Build Tool**: Standard Go Build with cross-compilation support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Binary Size**: Must remain under 50MB [Source: Epic 1, AC 6]
- **Target Platforms**: macOS and Linux [Source: Epic 1, AC 4]

### Naming Conventions
- **File Names**: snake_case (e.g., `session_start.go`, `state_manager.go`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Package Names**: lowercase (e.g., `hooks`, `state`, `tui`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Structure**: Unit tests should be co-located with source files using `_test.go` suffix [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-structure]
**Test Framework**: Go Testing with table-driven test patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Project Structure Alignment
Directory structure in acceptance criteria perfectly aligns with architecture document. No conflicts found.

## Testing
### Test Requirements from Architecture
- **Test Framework**: Built-in Go testing with table-driven patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Test File Locations**: Co-located with source files using `_test.go` suffix [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-structure]
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for build system validation [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

### Specific Testing for This Story
- Verify `go mod init` creates valid go.mod file
- Validate all dependencies can be imported without errors
- Test build process produces executable binary
- Verify binary size constraints (<50MB)
- Test cross-platform compilation for macOS and Linux

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality. The project structure perfectly aligns with architectural requirements and follows Go best practices. All dependencies are properly managed, build system is robust with cross-platform support, and the CLI foundation is clean and extensible.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was needed during this review. The code is already well-structured, properly formatted, and follows all established conventions.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Perfect compliance with naming conventions, single binary rule
- Project Structure: ✓ Exact match to unified project structure requirements
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and build tests following table-driven patterns
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**AC 1: Go module initialized** → Validated by build_test.go TestBuildSystem()
**AC 2: Directory structure created** → Validated by build_test.go TestBuildSystem() + manual verification
**AC 3: Single Makefile compiles binary** → Validated by build_test.go TestCompilation()
**AC 4: Build works on macOS/Linux** → Validated by Makefile cross-compilation targets
**AC 5: All dependencies imported** → Validated by go.mod inspection and successful build
**AC 6: Binary size <50MB** → Validated by build_test.go TestBinarySize() (actual: ~3.5MB)

### Improvements Checklist

All improvements completed during development:
- [x] Project structure created with all required directories
- [x] Build system implemented with cross-platform support
- [x] Comprehensive test suite covering all requirements
- [x] Dependency management properly configured
- [x] Binary size optimization achieved (93% under limit)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is foundational infrastructure code with no exposed attack surfaces.

### Performance Considerations

Binary size is excellent at ~3.5MB (93% under the 50MB requirement). Build times are fast and cross-compilation works seamlessly.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this QA review - the implementation was already excellent.

### Gate Status
