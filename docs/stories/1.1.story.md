# Story 1.1: Project Setup and CLI Structure

## Status

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a well-structured Go project with CLI commands,
**so that** I can easily extend and maintain the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### Project Structure
Based on [Source: architecture/source-tree.md], the following structure must be created:

```
spcstr/
├── cmd/
│   └── spcstr/
│       └── main.go                 # Application entry point
├── internal/
│   ├── cli/
│   │   ├── root.go                 # Root command setup
│   │   ├── init.go                 # Init command implementation (placeholder)
│   │   ├── run.go                  # Run command implementation (placeholder)
│   │   ├── config.go               # Config command implementation (placeholder)
│   │   └── version.go              # Version command (placeholder)
├── go.mod                           # Go module definition
├── go.sum                           # Dependency checksums (auto-generated)
├── Makefile                         # Build automation

├── LICENSE                          # MIT License
└── README.md                        # Project documentation
```

### Technology Stack
From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Language:** Go 1.21.0 - Primary development language
- **CLI Framework:** Cobra 1.8.0 - Command-line interface framework
- **Testing:** Go testing stdlib - Standard Go testing package
- **Testing Mock:** testify 1.8.4 - Test assertions and mocks
- **Linting:** golangci-lint 1.55.0 - Code quality
- **Build Tool:** Make - Build automation

### Coding Standards
Critical rules from [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Never use fmt.Print/Println** - Use log/slog for all output
- **All errors must be wrapped with context using %w** - Enables proper error tracing
- **Never panic in library code** - Only main() can panic on fatal errors
- **All public types must have godoc comments** - Documentation is mandatory
- **File naming:** Use snake_case.go (e.g., `session_manager.go`)
- **Package names:** lowercase, no underscores (e.g., `cli`)

### Testing Requirements
From [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- **Test files:** {filename}_test.go in same package
- **Coverage requirement:** 80% for core packages like CLI
- **Test pattern:** Use table-driven tests (see section "Testing Patterns")
- **Mocking:** Use testify/mock 1.8.4 for mocking
- **Test organization:** One test file per source file

Example test pattern:
```go
func TestRootCommand_Execute(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        args    []string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"no args", []string{}, false},
        {"help flag", []string{"--help"}, false},
        {"invalid flag", []string{"--invalid"}, true},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Technical Constraints
- Go version must be exactly 1.21.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Cobra version must be exactly 1.8.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All dependencies must use go.mod for management
- Makefile is required for build automation [mentioned in Epic 1 Story 1.1 AC]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
From [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- Test file location: Same directory as source, with _test.go suffix
- Test framework: Go standard library testing package
- Mock framework: testify/mock 1.8.4
- Coverage target: 80% for CLI package
- Test pattern: Table-driven tests (preferred)
- All public methods must have tests
- Error paths must be explicitly tested

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the initial project setup story. The code demonstrates strong adherence to Go best practices, proper error handling, and follows the specified coding standards. The project structure is clean and well-organized, with comprehensive test coverage exceeding requirements.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: /Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/spcstr/main.go (root level)
  - **Change**: Removed redundant main.go file at project root
  - **Why**: This file contained only a placeholder comment and conflicted with the proper entry point at cmd/spcstr/main.go
  - **How**: Eliminates confusion and maintains clean project structure per Go standards

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All standards met - proper use of slog, error handling, no fmt.Print usage
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches specified structure exactly (after cleanup)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Table-driven tests with 97.4% coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: Go module initialized with appropriate package structure**

- ✓ Validated through root_test.go (100% coverage)

**AC3: Main entry point established with proper error handling**
- ✓ cmd/spcstr/main.go with panic recovery
- ✓ Structured logging with slog
- ✓ Proper error handling and exit codes

**AC4: Makefile created for common development tasks**
