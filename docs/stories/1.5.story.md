# Story 1.5: TUI Foundation and Navigation

## Status
In Rework

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to launch the TUI and navigate between views,
**so that** I can access planning documents and session data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `spcstr` launches TUI using Bubbletea framework
2. Header shows current view and session status
3. Footer displays context-aware keybinds that update per view
4. [p] switches to Plan view, [o] switches to Observe view, [q] quits
5. TUI detects if project not initialized and prompts to run init
6. View switching occurs in <100ms
7. Terminal resize handled gracefully

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 implementation:
- Root command in `cmd/spcstr/main.go` already configured to indicate TUI mode will be available
- Project initialization creates `.spcstr/{logs,sessions}` directory structure
- Main.go uses Cobra framework with established command patterns
- Version information available via build-time variables

### TUI Framework Setup
**Bubbletea Application Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:
```go
type Component struct {
    width  int
    height int
    styles lipgloss.Style
}

func (c Component) Init() tea.Cmd {
    return nil
}

func (c Component) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case tea.WindowSizeMsg:
        c.width = msg.Width
        c.height = msg.Height
    case tea.KeyMsg:
        return c.handleKeys(msg)
    }
    return c, nil
}

func (c Component) View() string {
    return c.styles.Render("Component content")
}
```

### Application State Structure
**TUI State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]:
```go
type AppState struct {
    currentView    ViewType      // plan, observe
    planState     *PlanState    // Plan view state
    observeState  *ObserveState // Observe view state
    windowSize    tea.WindowSizeMsg
    initialized   bool
}
```
Note: TUI state is separate from session state and not persisted between runs.

### Navigation Architecture
**Key Bindings and Routing** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]:
- Global Keys: 'p' → Plan View, 'o' → Observe View, 'q' → Quit
- Key handler routing pattern for navigation between views
- View-specific handlers called based on currentView state

### Component Organization
**File Structure Requirements** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

### Technology Stack
**Required Dependencies** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Bubbletea v0.25+ for TUI framework
- Lipgloss v0.9+ for terminal styling
- Glamour v0.6+ for markdown rendering (future stories)
- fsnotify v1.7+ for file watching (future stories)

### Coding Standards
**Critical Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]:
- Single Binary Rule: All functionality through main spcstr binary
- Context Timeouts: Use context.WithTimeout for file operations
- Resource Cleanup: Always defer cleanup in error paths
- File Path Safety: Use filepath.Join() for path construction

### Error Handling
**TUI Error Display**:
- Display user-friendly error messages in TUI
- Provide actionable guidance (e.g., "Run 'spcstr init' to initialize")
- Log detailed errors to `.spcstr/logs/` for debugging
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable

### Performance Requirements
**View Switching** [Source: Epic 1, Story 1.5 AC6]:
- View switching must occur in <100ms
- Use lazy loading for view content
- Maintain view state when switching
- Profile with `time.Since()` to verify performance

### Testing

### Test Requirements from Architecture
**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Built-in Go testing with table-driven patterns
- Unit tests co-located with source using `_test.go` suffix
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` directory

## QA Results

### Initial Implementation Issues Found

#### Issue 1: Blank Screen on Launch
**Problem**: TUI launched but displayed completely blank screen, though keyboard shortcuts (q to quit) worked.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Components were returning empty strings when `width == 0`
2. Bubbletea sends `WindowSizeMsg` after initialization, but views were initialized in `Init()` before receiving size
3. Each component's `View()` method checked `if width == 0 { return "" }`, causing blank output

**Files Affected**:
- `internal/tui/app/app.go:194-274` - View() method returning empty when components not ready
- `internal/tui/views/plan/plan.go:54-57` - Returns empty string if width/height is 0
- `internal/tui/views/observe/observe.go:54-57` - Same issue
- `internal/tui/components/header/header.go:60-63` - Returns empty if width is 0
- `internal/tui/components/footer/footer.go` - Similar pattern

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `app.go:View()` to always provide fallback content
- Initialize components with window size when available
- Simplified rendering logic to ensure something is always displayed

#### Issue 2: Content Wider Than Terminal
**Problem**: TUI content extends beyond terminal width, causing wrapping issues and broken layout.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Components are setting explicit widths without considering actual terminal constraints
2. Border/padding styles add extra width not accounted for
3. Not following Lipgloss best practices for responsive layouts

**Specific Issues**:
- `internal/tui/views/plan/plan.go:68-71` - Uses `Width(m.width - 4)` but doesn't account for container padding
- `internal/tui/app/app.go:renderPlaceholderView()` - Creates bordered box without proper width constraints
- Components not using `lipgloss.Width()` to measure actual rendered width

**Required Fix**:
- Study Lipgloss examples for proper width handling: https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/tree/master/examples
- Use `MaxWidth()` instead of `Width()` for responsive layouts
- Account for borders and padding in width calculations

### Lessons Learned

#### Critical Bubbletea Patterns Not Followed:
1. **Initialization Sequence**: Should not rely on component state in `Init()`. Components should handle nil/zero states gracefully.
   - Reference: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/examples/simple

2. **Window Size Handling**: Must handle initial render before `WindowSizeMsg` arrives
   - Reference: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/examples/split-editors

3. **View Method Contract**: `View()` must ALWAYS return displayable content, never empty string
   - Reference: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/examples/views

#### Lipgloss Style Issues:
1. **Width Management**: Should use `MaxWidth()` for responsive design, not fixed `Width()`
   - Reference: https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/tree/master/examples/layout

2. **Border Calculations**: Borders and padding consume space that must be subtracted from content width
   - Formula: `contentWidth = terminalWidth - borderWidth - (padding * 2)`

3. **Composite Layouts**: Should build layouts using `JoinVertical` and `JoinHorizontal` with proper constraints
   - Reference: https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/tree/master/examples/table

### Recommended Refactoring

Based on Bubbletea/Lipgloss examples, the architecture should be:

1. **Simple State Management** (like examples/spinner):
   - Minimal state in model
   - Handle all edge cases in View()
   - Don't assume initialization order

2. **Responsive Layout** (like examples/split-editors):
   - Use percentage-based widths
   - Calculate sizes dynamically in View()
   - Never hardcode dimensions

3. **Component Pattern** (like examples/list-simple):
   - Components should be self-contained
   - Pass dimensions via Update messages
   - Always provide fallback rendering

### Action Items for Fix:
1. [ ] Review and implement patterns from ~/Workspace/contrib/bubbletea/examples/realtime
2. [ ] Apply responsive width handling from ~/Workspace/contrib/lipgloss/examples/layout
3. [ ] Refactor component initialization to match ~/Workspace/contrib/bubbletea/examples/views
4. [ ] Add proper width constraint handling using MaxWidth() instead of Width()
5. [ ] Implement proper border/padding calculations
