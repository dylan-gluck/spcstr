# Story 1.7: Observe View Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to view real-time session data in the TUI,
**so that** I can monitor agent activities and file operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Left pane lists all sessions from `.spcstr/sessions/` with ID and status
2. Sessions marked as active/completed based on session_active field
3. Right pane shows dashboard for selected session with data from state.json
4. Dashboard displays: session id, count of active agents, current_agents, agents_history, files (new/edited/read), tools_used, todo pending/complete
5. File watching via fsnotify triggers dashboard refresh when state.json changes
6. Recent activity shows prompts and notifications in chronological order
7. Task counts displayed if TODO data available in state

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**From Story 1.5 & 1.6 Change Proposals:**
- TUI implementation simplified to follow Bubbletea/Lipgloss examples
- Use simple width calculations instead of complex percentages
- Always use MaxWidth/MaxHeight to prevent overflow
- Component structure: single Model with Init/Update/View methods
- Keep layout logic simple - let lipgloss handle composition

### Relevant Architecture Details

**Component Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
```go
type Model struct {
    width       int
    height      int
    state       *ObserveState
    fileWatcher *FileWatcherService
    initialized bool
}

type ObserveState struct {
    sessions      []SessionState
    selected      int
    dashboard     DashboardData
    lastUpdate    time.Time
    focusedPane   PaneType
}
```

**File Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
```
internal/tui/views/observe/
├── observe.go    # Main observe view controller
└── dashboard.go  # Dashboard rendering logic
```

**SessionState Data Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md, internal/state/types.go]
```go
type SessionState struct {
    SessionID     string                 `json:"session_id"`
    CreatedAt     time.Time             `json:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt     time.Time             `json:"updated_at"`
    SessionActive bool                  `json:"session_active"`
    Agents        []string              `json:"agents"`
    AgentsHistory []AgentExecution      `json:"agents_history"`
    Files         FileOperations        `json:"files"`
    ToolsUsed     map[string]int        `json:"tools_used"`
    Errors        []ErrorEntry          `json:"errors"`
    Prompts       []PromptEntry         `json:"prompts"`
    Notifications []NotificationEntry    `json:"notifications"`
    Todos         TodoState             `json:"todos"`
}

type TodoState struct {
    Total       int        `json:"total"`
    Pending     int        `json:"pending"`
    InProgress  int        `json:"in_progress"`
    Completed   int        `json:"completed"`
    Recent      []TodoItem `json:"recent"`
    LastUpdated string     `json:"last_updated"`
}
```

**State Manager Integration** [Source: internal/state/manager.go]
- Use `state.NewStateManager(basePath)` to create manager
- Call `LoadState(ctx, sessionID)` to load session data
- State files located at `.spcstr/sessions/{session-id}/state.json`

**File Watching Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
```go
// Use fsnotify for file watching
watcher, _ := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
watcher.Add(filepath)

// Poll for events in Update method
func watchForChanges() tea.Cmd {
    return tea.Tick(time.Millisecond*100, func(t time.Time) tea.Msg {
        select {
        case event := <-watcher.Events:
            if event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {
                return fileChangedMsg{path: event.Name}
            }
        default:
            return nil
        }
        return nil
    })
}
```

**Layout Pattern from Plan View** [Source: internal/tui/views/plan/plan.go]
```go
// Simple pane width calculation
leftPaneWidth := m.width / 3
rightPaneWidth := m.width - leftPaneWidth - 1

// Render with MaxWidth/MaxHeight
return paneStyle.
    Width(width).
    Height(height).
    MaxWidth(width).
    MaxHeight(height).
    Render(content)
```

**Example Populated State** [Source: .spcstr/sessions/86e36ac8-a8f1-427a-a6c9-adbef147ff57/state.json]
The referenced state.json shows a complete example with:
- Multiple file operations (new, edited, read)
- Tools usage counts (Bash: 18, Edit: 9, etc.)
- Todo state with 8 completed tasks
- Prompts with timestamps
- Notifications array
This provides a real-world example for testing dashboard rendering.

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files location: `internal/tui/views/observe/observe_test.go`
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Test with different terminal sizes: 80x24, 120x40, edge cases
- Mock file system operations using temp directories
- Test file watcher with simulated events
- Focus on behavior over exact layout calculations

**Test Patterns:**
```go
func TestObserveView(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        width    int
        height   int
        sessions []SessionState
        expected string
    }{
        // Test cases
    }
}
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is well-structured and follows established TUI patterns from previous stories. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns, proper state management, and reactive UI updates. The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with a clean, maintainable architecture.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code follows established patterns and best practices appropriately.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Go conventions and project style guide
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly placed in internal/tui/views/observe/
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **Unit tests not implemented** (marked as incomplete in story)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Session list with active/inactive indicators (AC1, AC2)
- [x] Dashboard with comprehensive data display (AC3, AC4)
- [x] File watching for real-time updates (AC5)
- [x] Recent activity display (AC6)
- [x] Todo task counts and summaries (AC7)
- [ ] **Add unit tests for session discovery and loading**
- [ ] **Add unit tests for dashboard formatting**
- [ ] **Add unit tests for file watcher event handling**
- [ ] **Add unit tests for navigation state changes**
- [ ] Consider adding error recovery for file watcher failures
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut hints in UI

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation:
- Uses proper context handling
- Avoids exposing sensitive session data
- Properly closes file watchers to prevent resource leaks
- Uses safe file path operations

### Performance Considerations

Good performance characteristics observed:
- Efficient file watching with fsnotify
- Proper cleanup of watchers when switching sessions
- Lazy loading of session data on view initialization
- Throttled file change checks (500ms tick)
- Limited display of recent items to prevent UI overload

Minor optimization opportunities:
- Consider caching session list to reduce filesystem reads on refresh
- Could batch file change events to reduce re-renders

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.7-observe-view-implementation.yml
Risk profile: Low risk implementation with missing test coverage
NFR assessment: All NFRs satisfied

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

**Primary concern**: Unit tests are required for production readiness. The implementation is solid but lacks test coverage which is essential for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. Tests should be added before marking as Done.
