# Story 1.2: State Management Package

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the shared state management library,
**so that** both TUI and hook commands can read/write session state atomically.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `internal/state/` package implements InitializeState, LoadState, UpdateState, AtomicWrite functions
2. State operations use temp file + rename pattern for atomic writes
3. JSON marshaling/unmarshaling follows exact schema from hooks-state-management.md
4. State files created at `.spcstr/sessions/{session-id}/state.json`
5. All timestamp fields use ISO8601 format
6. Unit tests verify atomic write behavior

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 successfully established:
- Go project structure with `internal/state/` directory ready
- All dependencies available including standard library JSON support
- Build system working for development and testing

### Technical Requirements
- **Go Version**: 1.21+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Single Binary Rule**: State package must be internal and not importable externally [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]
- **Atomic Operations**: Must use temp file + rename pattern for all state modifications [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]

### Data Models
**SessionState Schema** (complete structure from architecture):
```go
type SessionState struct {
    SessionID       string            `json:"session_id"`
    CreatedAt       time.Time        `json:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt       time.Time        `json:"updated_at"`
    SessionActive   bool             `json:"session_active"`
    Agents          []string         `json:"agents"`
    AgentsHistory   []AgentExecution `json:"agents_history"`
    Files           FileOperations   `json:"files"`
    ToolsUsed       map[string]int   `json:"tools_used"`
    Errors          []ErrorEntry     `json:"errors"`
    Prompts         []PromptEntry    `json:"prompts"`
    Notifications   []NotificationEntry `json:"notifications"`
}

type AgentExecution struct {
    Name        string     `json:"name"`
    StartedAt   time.Time  `json:"started_at"`
    CompletedAt *time.Time `json:"completed_at,omitempty"`
}

type FileOperations struct {
    New    []string `json:"new"`
    Edited []string `json:"edited"`
    Read   []string `json:"read"`
}
```

### File Locations
Based on project structure requirements:
- **State Manager**: `internal/state/manager.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Atomic Operations**: `internal/state/atomic.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Data Types**: `internal/state/types.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **State Files**: `.spcstr/sessions/{session-id}/state.json` [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#file-system-schema]

### Atomic Write Implementation
Critical pattern required for state safety:
```go
func (a *AtomicWriter) WriteJSON(filename string, data interface{}) error {
    // 1. Marshal to JSON
    jsonData, err := json.MarshalIndent(data, "", "  ")
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // 2. Write to temporary file
    tempPath := filename + ".tmp"
    if err := os.WriteFile(tempPath, jsonData, 0644); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // 3. Atomic rename operation
    return os.Rename(tempPath, filename)
}
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#atomic-write-implementation]

### JSON Schema Compliance
- **Timestamp Format**: All time.Time fields must serialize to ISO8601 format [Source: architecture/data-models.md#sessionstate]
- **Field Names**: Use snake_case for JSON field tags [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Schema Validation**: Must match exact structure in database-schema.md [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#json-schema-examples]

### Technical Constraints
- **Context Timeouts**: Use context.WithTimeout for all file operations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]
- **File Path Safety**: Always use filepath.Join() and validate paths [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always defer file.Close() and handle cleanup in error paths [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]
- **Error Propagation**: Return appropriate errors for hook handlers [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-go-rules]

### Naming Conventions
- **Types**: PascalCase (e.g., `SessionState`, `AtomicWriter`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Functions**: PascalCase for exported, camelCase for internal [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **File Names**: snake_case (e.g., `atomic.go`, `manager.go`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Project Structure Alignment
All file paths and directory structure perfectly align with unified project structure. No conflicts identified.

## Testing

### Test Requirements from Architecture
- **Test Framework**: Built-in Go testing with table-driven test patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Test File Locations**: Co-located with source files using `_test.go` suffix [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-structure]
- **Test Structure**: Unit tests in `internal/state/` for atomic operations and CRUD [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-structure]

### Specific Testing for This Story
**Atomic Write Testing** (critical for story success):
```go
func TestAtomicWrite(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        data     interface{}
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name: "valid session state",
            data: &SessionState{
                SessionID:     "test_session",
                CreatedAt:     time.Now(),
                SessionActive: true,
            },
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // Additional test cases...
    }
    // Test implementation with temp directory and concurrent operations
}
```
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#state-management-unit-test]

**State Manager CRUD Testing**:
- Test InitializeState creates correct directory structure
- Test LoadState handles missing files gracefully
- Test UpdateState performs atomic writes
- Test JSON schema compliance with exact field formats
- Test ISO8601 timestamp serialization/deserialization
