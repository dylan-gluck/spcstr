implementation_quality:
  strengths:
    - 'Follows established TUI patterns from stories 1.5 and 1.6'
    - 'Clean separation of concerns between model, update, and view'
    - 'Proper state management with ObserveState struct'
    - 'Reactive UI updates with file watching'
    - 'Good error handling and user feedback'
  areas_for_improvement:
    - 'Test coverage is critical missing piece'
    - 'Could benefit from more robust error recovery'
    - 'UI could provide keyboard shortcut hints'
