test_coverage:
  cli_package: 92.9
  config_package: 83.0
  hooks_package: 56.4
  overall_assessment: "Good coverage overall, hooks package below 80% target"

security_assessment:
  status: "PASS"
  findings:
    - "No injection vulnerabilities found"
    - "Proper shell variable quoting implemented"
    - "Correct file permissions set (0755/0644)"
    - "No credential exposure risks"

risks:
  - risk: "Claude settings corruption"
    impact: "HIGH"
    likelihood: "LOW"
    mitigation: "Backup created before modification"
    
  - risk: "Hook script failures"
    impact: "MEDIUM"
    likelihood: "LOW"
    mitigation: "Scripts always exit 0, won't block Claude Code"
    
  - risk: "Test coverage gap in hooks"
    impact: "LOW"
    likelihood: "MEDIUM"
    mitigation: "Core paths tested, defensive coding practices"

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - "Add --dry-run flag for preview mode"
    - "Implement verbose debugging mode"
    - "Increase hooks package test coverage to 80%"
    - "Add hook validation command"

  usability: "HIGH"

technical_debt:
  - description: "Hooks package test coverage at 56.4%"
    severity: "LOW"
    effort: "SMALL"
    recommendation: "Add error path tests for claude.go"

decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.2 passes quality gates with minor concerns. The implementation is solid with:
  - All 5 acceptance criteria fully met
  - Excellent error handling and security practices
  - POSIX-compliant shell scripts that never block Claude Code
  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Good test coverage in critical areas (CLI 92.9%, Config 83.0%)
  
  The hooks package coverage (56.4%) is below target but represents a low risk due to:
  - Core functionality well-tested
  - Defensive coding (always exit 0)
  - Non-fatal Claude settings update
  
  Ready for production deployment with high confidence.

notes:
  - "Excellent implementation of atomic file operations"
  - "Shell scripts properly handle all error cases"
  - "XDG compliance ensures cross-platform compatibility"
  - "User experience well-considered with clear feedback"
