# Infrastructure and Deployment

## Infrastructure as Code
- **Tool:** Make + Go Build System
- **Location:** `Makefile` and `scripts/`
- **Approach:** Build automation and cross-compilation targets for multiple platforms

## Deployment Strategy
- **Strategy:** Binary Distribution via Package Managers
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (recommended)
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Environments
- **Development:** Local development with hot reload support via `make run`
- **Testing:** Automated test environment in CI pipeline with fixtures
- **Production:** End-user installations via Homebrew, apt, yum package managers

## Environment Promotion Flow
```
Development (local) 
    ↓ (git push)
CI/CD Pipeline
    ↓ (tests pass)
Build Artifacts
    ↓ (tag release)
GitHub Releases
    ↓ (package managers)
Production (user machines)
```

## Rollback Strategy
- **Primary Method:** Version pinning in package managers
- **Trigger Conditions:** User-reported critical bugs or data corruption
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 1 hour via package manager update

## Build and Distribution Details

**Makefile Targets:**
```makefile
# Development
make build        # Build for current platform
make run         # Run with hot reload
make test        # Run all tests
make lint        # Run golangci-lint
make clean       # Clean build artifacts

# Release
make release     # Build for all platforms
make package     # Create distribution packages
make sign        # Sign binaries for macOS
```

**Cross-Platform Builds:**
- Linux: amd64, arm64
- macOS: amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- Windows: amd64 (via WSL support)

**Distribution Channels:**
1. **Homebrew (macOS/Linux)**
   - Formula in homebrew-tap repository
   - Auto-update via brew upgrade

2. **APT (Debian/Ubuntu)**
   - .deb package with systemd integration
   - Repository hosting on packagecloud.io

3. **YUM (RHEL/Fedora)**
   - .rpm package
   - Repository hosting on packagecloud.io

4. **Direct Download**
   - GitHub Releases with checksums
   - Signed binaries for verification

**CI/CD Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Test Stage**
   - Unit tests with coverage
   - Integration tests
   - Linting and static analysis

2. **Build Stage**
   - Cross-compilation for all platforms
   - Version injection from git tags
   - Binary optimization with -ldflags

3. **Package Stage**
   - Platform-specific packaging
   - Checksum generation
   - Code signing (macOS)

4. **Release Stage**
   - GitHub Release creation
   - Package manager updates
   - Documentation deployment

**Version Management:**
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Git tags trigger release builds
- Version embedded in binary at build time
