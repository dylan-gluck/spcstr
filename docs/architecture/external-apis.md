# External APIs

Based on the PRD requirements and component design, this project does **not require any external API integrations**. Spec⭐️ is a completely local, self-contained terminal application that:

- Integrates with Claude Code through local file system hooks only
- Uses file-based persistence without any cloud storage
- Has no network dependencies or external service calls
- Operates entirely within the local development environment

All interactions are with:
- Local file system for session persistence
- Local shell scripts for Claude Code hooks
- Local markdown documents for Plan View
- Local configuration files

This design aligns with the PRD's goals of creating a single-binary tool with no runtime dependencies and ensures the application works offline without any external service requirements.
