# External APIs

*No external APIs required - spcstr is designed as a completely offline, privacy-preserving tool.*

All integration occurs through:
- **Claude Code:** Via hook command execution (local process spawning)
- **File System:** Direct file operations for state and document management
- **Package Managers:** For distribution only (brew, apt, pacman)
