# Next Steps

## Next Steps for Spec⭐️ Development

Since this project has a TUI interface (not a traditional web UI), the next steps are:

1. **For Development Team:**
   - Review this architecture with stakeholders
   - Set up the Go development environment with specified versions
   - Begin implementation with Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
   - Use Dev agent with this architecture as reference

2. **For Project Setup:**
   - Initialize Go module with `go mod init github.com/[org]/spcstr`
   - Create the directory structure as specified
   - Set up GitHub repository with CI/CD workflows
   - Configure linting and testing tools

3. **For Implementation:**
   - Start with Story 1.1: Project Setup and CLI Structure
   - Implement core components in order of dependencies
   - Write tests alongside implementation following test strategy

Note: No separate Frontend Architecture document is needed since this is a terminal-based application using Bubbletea for the TUI.
