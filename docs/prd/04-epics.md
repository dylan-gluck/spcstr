# Epic List

## Overview

The Spec⭐️ MVP is organized into 4 sequential epics that build upon each other:

1. **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
   - Establish project structure, implement init command, and create basic TUI shell with view switching

2. **Epic 2: Session Tracking & Persistence**
   - Implement hook scripts, session state management, and JSON persistence layer

3. **Epic 3: Plan View Implementation**
   - Build document indexing, markdown preview, and navigation features for planning documents

4. **Epic 4: Observe View & Dashboard**
   - Create session list, implement dashboard layout, and enable real-time session monitoring

Each epic delivers end-to-end functionality that can be tested and validated independently while building toward the complete MVP.
