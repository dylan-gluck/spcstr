# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a terminal-native experience that feels as responsive and intuitive as modern GUI applications while respecting terminal conventions and keyboard-driven workflows. The interface should provide information density without overwhelming users, using color and typography to create clear visual hierarchy.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- Vim-style keybindings for navigation (hjkl movement, modes)
- Tab-based focus switching between panels
- Modal overlays for detailed views and settings
- Incremental search with fuzzy matching for document discovery
- Real-time updates without disrupting user focus
- Context-sensitive help available at any point

## Core Screens and Views

- **Plan View**: Split-panel layout with document tree and preview
- **Observe View**: Split-panel layout with session list and dashboard
- **Spec Mode**: Indexed PRD/Architecture documents with navigation
- **Workflow Mode**: Epic and story management interface
- **Config Mode**: Settings viewer for claude/bmad/spcstr configuration
- **Session Dashboard**: Multi-section layout with agents, tasks, files, metrics
- **Help Overlay**: Context-sensitive keybinding reference

## Accessibility: Terminal Native

Terminal accessibility through standard screen reader support, high contrast color themes, and keyboard-only navigation.

## Branding

Minimal, professional aesthetic with subtle use of color for status indication. Star emoji (⭐️) as visual identifier. Monospace typography throughout for alignment and readability.

## Target Device and Platforms: Terminal/Console

Cross-platform terminal application supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL). Requires 80x24 minimum terminal size, optimized for standard developer terminal configurations.
