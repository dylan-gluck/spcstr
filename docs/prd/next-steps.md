# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

The spcstr PRD is complete and ready for UX design. Please create the information architecture and interaction design for the TUI, focusing on the two-view system (Plan and Observe) with keyboard navigation patterns. Pay special attention to the real-time dashboard layout for session observability and the document browser experience for planning materials.

## Architect Prompt

The spcstr PRD is complete and validated. Please create the technical architecture document specifying the Go monorepo structure, state management implementation, hook command system, and TUI framework integration. Focus on the single-binary approach with embedded hook functionality, atomic state operations, and real-time file watching for dashboard updates. The exact state schema and hook specifications are documented in the referenced planning documents.
