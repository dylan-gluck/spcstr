# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable real-time observability of Claude Code sessions through an intuitive TUI dashboard
- Automatically persist session state for analysis, replay, and recovery
- Provide seamless integration with BMad Method planning documents
- Support both planning and execution phases of development workflow
- Deliver sub-100ms UI responsiveness for all user interactions
- Create a single-binary tool installable via standard package managers
- Establish foundation for future multi-agent orchestration capabilities

## Background Context

Spec⭐️ addresses the critical gap in Claude Code development workflows where developers lack visibility into active AI-assisted coding sessions. As teams increasingly adopt Claude Code with the BMad Method, they need a purpose-built tool that provides real-time session monitoring, persistent state tracking, and integrated planning capabilities. The current landscape offers no terminal-native solutions that combine these capabilities, forcing developers to manually track session state and lose valuable context between sessions.

The solution leverages Claude Code's hook system to automatically capture session data without manual intervention, presenting it through a responsive TUI that developers can keep open alongside their development work. By maintaining session state in structured JSON format, Spec⭐️ enables session recovery, performance analysis, and workflow optimization that are impossible with current tooling.
