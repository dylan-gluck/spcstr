# PRD & EPIC VALIDATION SUMMARY

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 85%  
**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right  
**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready  
**Most Critical Concerns:** Minor gaps in error handling and performance monitoring

## Category Analysis Table

| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Monitoring approach minimal |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None |

## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH:**
- Error handling requirements could be more specific (NFR4 references but doesn't detail recovery strategies)
- Performance monitoring approach specified but minimal detail

**MEDIUM:**
- Data retention policies not addressed (logs will grow indefinitely)
- Support requirements not documented (though appropriate for open-source MVP)

**LOW:**
- Future integration points could be more explicit
- Configuration management deferred but mentioned

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope is appropriately minimal:**
- Single binary with embedded hooks eliminates distribution complexity
- Two-view TUI focuses on core observability needs
- State management system is well-defined and bounded
- No feature creep evident

**No missing essential features identified**

**Complexity is manageable:**
- File watching for real-time updates is standard Go practice
- JSON-based state management is simple and reliable
- Hook system follows Claude Code specifications exactly

**Timeline appears realistic** for focused 2-3 day sprint

## Technical Readiness

**Technical constraints are clear:**
- Go 1.21+ requirement specified
- Single binary architecture defined
- Exact dependency list provided (Cobra, Bubbletea, Lipgloss, Glamour)

**Technical risks identified and mitigated:**
- Atomic writes specified for state safety
- Hook timeout constraints acknowledged
- File watching performance considered

**Areas for architect investigation:** None blocking, all implementation details

## Recommendations

1. **Address error handling specifics:** Define what happens when hooks fail or TUI encounters corrupted state files
2. **Add basic monitoring:** Specify how to detect if hooks are working correctly
3. **Consider log rotation:** Add basic policy to prevent log files from growing indefinitely

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The identified gaps are minor and won't block implementation planning.
