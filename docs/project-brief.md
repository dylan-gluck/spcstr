# Project Brief: Spec⭐️ (spcstr)

## Executive Summary

Spec⭐️ (spcstr) is a multi-session observability TUI (Terminal User Interface) designed specifically for Claude Code development workflows. It provides real-time visibility into active coding sessions, comprehensive planning document management, and seamless integration with the BMad Method framework. The primary problem being solved is the lack of visibility and orchestration capabilities when managing complex multi-agent development sessions in Claude Code. The target market is developers and teams using Claude Code with the BMad Method for software development projects. The key value proposition is providing a single pane of glass for monitoring session activity, managing planning documents, and orchestrating development workflows.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Developers using Claude Code currently lack visibility into active sessions, making it difficult to track progress across multiple agents and tasks. Session data is ephemeral and not persistently tracked, leading to lost context between sessions. There's no centralized way to view files changed, tools used, or errors encountered across sessions.

### Impact of the Problem

This lack of observability results in:
- Lost productivity as developers must manually track session state
- Difficulty coordinating multi-agent workflows
- No way to analyze session performance or identify bottlenecks
- Inability to resume interrupted sessions with full context
- Missing audit trail for development activities

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current terminal-based development tools don't integrate with Claude Code's hook system. Generic observability tools aren't tailored for AI-assisted development workflows. File-based tracking systems don't provide real-time updates or dashboard views.

### Urgency and Importance

As AI-assisted development becomes mainstream, teams need proper tooling to manage and observe these new workflows. The rapid adoption of Claude Code requires purpose-built observability solutions to maximize developer productivity.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

Spec⭐️ provides a TUI application that automatically tracks all Claude Code session data through hook integration. It presents this data in an intuitive dashboard with multiple views for planning (Plan View) and monitoring (Observe View). The system maintains persistent session state in JSON format, enabling session replay, analysis, and resumption.

### Key Differentiators

- Native integration with Claude Code hooks for automatic data collection
- Dual-purpose interface combining planning and observability
- Real-time updates without manual intervention
- Lightweight shell scripts for minimal overhead
- Single executable installation via standard package managers

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

It leverages Claude Code's existing hook system for seamless integration. The TUI approach provides rich interactivity while remaining terminal-native. Go's performance ensures minimal resource overhead even with multiple active sessions.

### High-level Vision

Create the de facto standard for Claude Code session observability, eventually expanding to support other AI coding assistants and becoming the central hub for AI-assisted development workflows.
